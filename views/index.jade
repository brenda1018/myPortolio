            | This website was created during my 8-week mentorship program with Microsoft. We created a club website for Hermanas Unidas de SFSU, a social Latinx organization. We designed this Django application to allow club officers to create and schedule announcements to the group at large. Officers are granted admin privileges which can be additionally granted or revoked as they see fit.

          p.card-text
            | This application was developed during the fall semester as part of an academic project. It is a full-stack application built with React.js, Express.js, and Node.js. It facilitates employment connections between employers and job seekers. The goal was to establish a user-friendly platform that speeds up the hiring process by advancing interactions between job seekers and employers. The application offers two different sign-in methods fit to the user's role, which strengthens the overall accessibility and functionality of the platform.
